# About me

< Hello world />, I'm Jose Manuel, better known in networks as "jtax", I'm a full stack web developer where I have created and maintained web applications for clients from all types of industries. Which has allowed me to see many different cases of strategies and all kinds of errors.

Currently, I work for marketing agencies, which allows me to see all kinds of sites, always allowing me to do new tasks, working closely with design and content teams, as well as account management teams. In many of my clients, the treatment is direct, which I love, as I can have direct feedback without going through other people's opinions.

As an independent person, I like to keep up to date with what's going on in the tech world, going to events to keep improving my skills and meet new people like me.

Feel free to contact me, I am open to all kinds of comments as well as having a nice chat..
